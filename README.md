# Little Golden Textures: A Minecraft Bedrock Texture Pack

LGT is inspiried by classic children's literature illustrations, such as the Little Golden Books, Wonder Story Books, and modern picture books.

The goal is to create a Minecraft world that's easy on the eyes and doesn't stray too far from vanilla Minecraft.
